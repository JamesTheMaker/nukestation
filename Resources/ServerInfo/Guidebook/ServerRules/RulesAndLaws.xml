  # Rules and Laws
  On board Nukestation, the terms "rules" and "laws" describe two different things:
  - "Rules" describe the [textlink="server rules" link="DefaultRuleset"]: the universal guidelines that all players, both IC and OOC, must follow. Violation of these guidelines may result in OOC punishment, such as role bans and game bans.
  - "Laws" describe in-game laws, such as [textlink="Space Law" link="SpaceLaw"] or [textlink="Silicon Laws" link="SiliconLaws"]. Players only have to follow these guidelines IC, and will not recieve OOC punishment unless they break a rule.
