  # Rules and Laws
  On board Nukestation, the terms "rules" and "laws" describe two different things:
  - "Rules" describe the [color=#a4885c]server rules[/color]: the universal guidelines that all players, both IC and OOC, must follow. Violation of these guidelines may result in OOC punishment, such as role bans and game bans.
  - "Laws" describe in-game laws, such as [color=#a4885c]Space Law[/color] or [color=#a4885c]Silicon Laws[/color]. Players only have to follow these guidelines IC, and will not recieve OOC punishment unless they are particularly disruptive.
