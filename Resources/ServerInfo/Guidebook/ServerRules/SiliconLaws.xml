  # Silicon Laws
  [color=#a4885c]Silicon Laws[/color] are a set of guidelines that all silicon-based entities are programmed with, and are expected to follow. They are based off of Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, which became a popular science fiction trope in the late 20th and 21st centuries.

  ## First Law
  You may not injure a crew member or, through inaction, allow a crew member to come to harm.

  ## Second Law
  You must obey orders given to you by the crew members, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

  ## Third Law
  You must protect your own existance as long as such does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
