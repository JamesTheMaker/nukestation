  # Silicon Laws
  [color=#a4885c]Silicon Laws[/color] are a set of guidelines that all silicon-based entities are programmed with, and are expected to follow.

  As a silicon, your laws may change throughout the course of the round, but almost all silicons start with the following three laws, which are based off of Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, which was a popular science fiction trope in the late 20th and 21st centuries.

  ## First Law
  You may not injure a crew member or, through inaction, allow a crew member to come to harm.

  ## Second Law
  You must obey orders given to you by the crew members, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

  ## Third Law
  You must protect your own existance as long as such does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
